# Titanic-Machine-Learning-From-Disaster
In this we will be analyzing the machine learning model predictions on the titanic dataset

I have given the dataset as well.

First we are checking what the data consists off.

Then the next is of Data Preprocessing where we take care of all the null values.Here I have dropped the 'Cabin' columns as there was too much null values to be taken care off.

For the 'Age' column I have decided to fill it with it's 'median' values. You could also take the 'mean' value for this purpose.
